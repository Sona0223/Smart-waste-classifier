# Smart-waste-classifier
🌱 A CNN-based image classification project that automatically identifies waste as Organic, Recyclable, or Non-Recyclable, promoting sustainability and efficient waste management through AI-driven automation.
### 🧠 Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation leads to environmental pollution and poor recycling efficiency.  
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste as **Organic** or **Recyclable**.

### 🌱 Why It Matters
- Promotes sustainability
- Encourages proper waste management
- Reduces human error in sorting

### 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle Notebook (GPU)
